A Chrome extension that brings modular audio effects processing to your browser. Build custom audio effect chains with a visual node-based interface and apply them to any audio/video content in real-time.

## Features

### üéõÔ∏è Visual Audio Routing
- Intuitive drag-and-drop node interface
- Connect audio effects in any order
- Real-time visual feedback of your signal chain
- Inspired by modular synthesizers and audio production software

### üéµ Built-in Audio Effects

- **Speed Control** (0.5x - 1.5x)
  - Adjust playback speed with optional pitch preservation
  - Perfect for slowing down tutorials or speeding up podcasts

- **Reverb**
  - Add spatial depth to any audio
  - Adjustable room size, decay time, and wet/dry mix
  - From subtle ambience to massive halls

- **Delay**
  - Create echoes and rhythmic repeats
  - Control delay time, feedback, and mix
  - Sync to musical timing or create ambient textures

- **Utility (Gain & Pan)**
  - Precise volume control (-60dB to +12dB)
  - Stereo panning for spatial positioning
  - Phase reverse option for correcting phase issues
  - Essential for balancing your effect chain

- **Limiter**
  - Prevent audio clipping and distortion
  - Adjustable threshold (-60dB to 0dB)
  - Hard knee limiting with 20:1 ratio
  - Fast attack (3ms) for transparent limiting

- **Distortion**
  - Add harmonic richness and grit
  - Drive control (0-100%) for distortion intensity
  - Wet/dry mix for parallel processing
  - Soft clipping algorithm with 4x oversampling

### üöÄ Technical Highlights

- Built on Web Audio API for low-latency processing
- Works with all HTML5 audio/video elements
- Special optimization for SoundCloud and Web Audio API sources
- Wet/dry mixing on reverb, delay, and distortion effects
- Persistent settings across browser sessions
